<textarea rows="8" cols="80" class="textbox">
  The ocean is currently being polluted at an alarming rate killing millions of organisms a year. Last year alone ocean pollution killed a million seabirds. The ocean is being polluted by trash, runoff from cars, and agricultural fertilizers getting into our oceans. We can fix this by promoting recycling and by reducing our carbon emissions which leads to ocean acidification.
